  <p>Born on January 15 1988 in Los Angeles, California Skrillex aka Sonny Moore showed an interest in music from a very early age. His earliest memories of music include his parents listening to The Doors, and Sonny has described himself as that kid who would bang on pots and pans.

With the band, Sonny went on to release two albums, Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count in 2004 and Heroine in 2006.
